2.0
  * Cloned Avatars can share the same animation state. Clonable Avatars render their geometry in an internal buffered renderer.
  * TimeFunctions can be shared between many Animations (cloned animations)
  * Json data file type version 2
  * Vertices coordinates are rounded (to a precision of 1/255) by default when exporting to json
  * Renderers can draw with a fixed color (lockColor/unlockColor functions)
  * TimeFunction EaseFromTo start in DELAY state
  * Fixed ComplexShape.contains() bug when scaleX or scaleY is 0
  * Lots of refactoring


1.4
  * Renamed MyRenderer to PRenderer
  * New abstract class : Renderer
  * New Renderer class for buffered rendering : PGraphicsRenderer
  * Drawing to file functions removed from library
  * New class : MatrixStack


1.3
  * Prints library version when instantiating MyRenderer
  * Keeps retro compatibility with unversioned json files
  * Returns null when trying to read corrupted json files
  * BoundingBox class and getBoundingBox functions for Shape objects
  * Implemented contains method of class ComplexShape
  * Pivot/origin is automatically set to center of bounding box of ComplexShapes
  * paused property to Avatar class (suspend animation updating)
  * preTransform affine matrix for complexShape objects (gives ability keep modifications separated from original geometry)
  * Function resetTransform of ComplexShape class
  * Function invalidateBoundingBox of ComplexShape
  * Function getRootShape of ComplexShape class (needed by function "invalidateBoundingBox")
  * Getter and setter function for the pre-transform matrix of ComplexShape instances
  * Removed time function "TFConstant" (redundant with manual softTransform)
